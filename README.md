# AngularApp

School project from the second semester of 2021/2022. The goal of this project was to think of a website you wanted to make and make that website using Angular. This project was made in conjunction with a Mongodb/Neo4j server, my version of which is hosted [here](https://github.com/TeaDrinkingProgrammer/mongoose-server) (As of March 2022, that project is still in development). The project allows people to add entries of videos/podcasts/movies etc. that are usefull for language learning.

  ## Pitch (also available on the "about" page:
This project is a resource for language learners to find content (content
  being anything that can be watched and/or listened to) to aid their language
  learning  
  ### Content Finder  
  Content Finder is about helping you to find content to aid your language
  learning journey. You may have asked yourself this question:
  "I want to watch some series, movies, videos (or listen to some podcasts etc.)
  to practise my target language, but I cant find any."  
  
  Content Finder is here to help. We host a crowdsourced list of content you can
  watch/ listen to to practise any language and have features relevant to
  language learning.
  Think of it like Rotten Tomatoes or IMDB for languages learning.  
    
  Some of the features include:
<ul>
  <li>
    Reviews where fellow learners can share how a serie/movie etc. has helped
    them learn their language
  </li>
  <li>Tags to help you find the content you are looking for</li>
  <li>
    Information relevant to language learning like the target language, and the
    approximate difficulty level of the content
  </li>
</ul>
  The platform is free to use, the only thing we ask of users is that they
  submit some content in their native language.  
  It could be anything: a popular tv serie, some fun or popular movies, youtube
  videos: you name it!
