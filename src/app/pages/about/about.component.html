    <h1>About this website</h1>
</div>
<p> This website is about helping you to find content to aid your language learning journey. You may have asked yourself this question: </p>
<p> "I want to watch some series, movies, videos (or listen to some podcasts etc.) to practise my target language, but I cant find any."</p>
<p> This website is here to help. We host a crowdsourced list of content you can watch/ listen to to practise any language and have features relevant to language learning</p>
<p>Think of it like Rotten Tomatoes or IMDB for languages learners</p>
<p> Some of the features include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Reviews where fellow learners can share how a serie/movie etc. has helped them learn their language</li>
    <li>Tags to help you find the content you are looking for</li>
    <li>Information relevant to language learning like the target language, and the approximate difficulty level of the content</li>
</ul>

<p> The platform is free to use, the only thing we ask of users is that they submit some content in their native language.</p>
<p>It could be anything: a popular tv serie, some fun or popular movies, youtube videos: you name it!</p>
