  <h2>Content Finder</h2>
</div>
<p>
  Content Finder is about helping you to find content to aid your language
  learning journey. You may have asked yourself this question:
</p>
<p>
  "I want to watch some series, movies, videos (or listen to some podcasts etc.)
  to practise my target language, but I cant find any."
</p>
<p>
  Content Finder is here to help. We host a crowdsourced list of content you can
  watch/ listen to to practise any language and have features relevant to
  language learning
</p>
<p>Think of it like Rotten Tomatoes or IMDB for languages learning</p>
<p>Some of the features include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Reviews where fellow learners can share how a serie/movie etc. has helped
    them learn their language
  </li>
  <li>Tags to help you find the content you are looking for</li>
  <li>
    Information relevant to language learning like the target language, and the
    approximate difficulty level of the content
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The platform is free to use, the only thing we ask of users is that they
  submit some content in their native language.
</p>
<p>
  It could be anything: a popular tv serie, some fun or popular movies, youtube
  videos: you name it!
